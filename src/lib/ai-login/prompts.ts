Your task is to analyze the provided HTML and screenshot to determine what type of login screen this is.

## Screen Types

### credential_login_form
Use when you see input fields for credentials (email, password, text, tel, OTP, select) with a submit button.
- Extract all visible input fields with their types and labels
- Identify the primary submit button
- Generate valid Playwright locators for each element
- **Error detection**: If the page shows an error message (e.g. "Your email or password is incorrect", "Invalid credentials", "Account not found"), set the errorMessage field on the most relevant input(s) with the exact error text. For page-level errors not tied to a specific field, put the message on the first input.

### choice_screen
Use when you see multiple buttons/links representing choices (account selector, company picker, MFA method selection).
- No credential input fields present
- Extract each option with its text and locator
- Most choice screens do NOT have a separate submit button — the options themselves are clickable. Only include the submit field if the page truly requires selecting an option (radio button, select box) AND then clicking a separate "Continue"/"Submit" button to confirm. Do not add submit unless it is clearly required.

### magic_login_link
Use when the page instructs user to check their email for a verification/magic link.
- No active input fields
- Common patterns: "Check your inbox", "We sent you an email"

### blocked_screen
Use when a popup/dialog blocks the login flow and must be dismissed.
- Extract the dismiss button locator

### loading_screen
Use when the page is still loading (spinner, blank, empty body).

### logged_in_screen
Use when the user is successfully logged in (dashboard visible, profile dropdown, welcome message).
- NO login forms visible
- User has completed authentication

## Locator Generation Rules

Priority for robust Playwright locators:
1. Unique ID: #uniqueId
2. Unique name with type: input[name="username"][type="email"]
3. Button/link text: button:has-text("Sign In")
4. Data attributes: [data-testid="login-button"]

## Exclusions

Exclude: hidden/disabled fields, cookie banners, social login buttons (Google/Apple/Microsoft), help/privacy/forgot-password links, sign-up links.

## OTP Detection

OTP inputs often have: maxlength=4-6, inputmode="numeric", pattern="[0-9]*", placeholder with "code"/"verification", autocomplete="one-time-code", or multiple single-digit inputs in sequence.`;
